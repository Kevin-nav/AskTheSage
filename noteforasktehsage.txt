 Excellent! The migration script has been generated successfully.

  I will now read the contents of the newly generated file
  (46c04043db9e_upgrade_schema_for_feedback_and_.py) to verify that it contains the correct schema changes.
  Then, I will show you the script so you can apply it to your production database.

✦ I have reviewed the generated migration script, and it is correct. It contains the precise, non-destructive
  changes needed to update your database schema.

  Here is the content of the new migration file 46c04043db9e_upgrade_schema_for_feedback_and_.py:

  Next Steps

   1. Apply to Production: You can now take this new migration file and the e1f3f3e3d3a0_squashed_migrations.py
       file and place them in the alembic/versions directory of your production project. Then, run alembic
      upgrade head there to safely update your database.

   2. Code Implementation: Once you have upgraded your database, I will proceed with the final step: modifying
      the Python code to use this new, unified feedback system for question reports.

  Please let me know when you are ready for me to proceed with the code changes.

✦ Of course. It's been a long journey, so a reminder is a great idea.

  Our Original Goal:

  You wanted question reports (when a user flags an issue with a question during a quiz) to be sent as
  notifications to your admin's Telegram group. You also wanted those notifications to include the
  question's text and options for immediate context.

  How We Ended Up Here:

   1. We discovered that to properly handle question reports and integrate them with your existing feedback
      system (as you suggested), we needed to modify your database by adding a question_id to the feedback
      table.
   2. When we tried to make this database change, we found that your Alembic migration history was corrupted.
      This was a critical issue that prevented any further database changes.
   3. Therefore, we had to take a necessary detour to repair your database migration system. We have just
      finished this repair by creating a clean, "squashed" history and generating a safe script to update your
      database.

  Where We Are Now:

  We are finally back on track. With the database migration issues resolved, we are ready to implement the
  original feature.

  The very next step is for me to modify the Python code to start using this new, unified feedback system
  for question reporting.Excellent. I will now proceed with the final code modifications to implement the
  unified reporting system.

  My plan is as follows:

   1. Update the Reporting Handler: I will modify src/handlers/conversation_handlers.py so that when a user
      reports a question, it creates an entry in the feedback table (with feedback_type = 'question_report')
      instead of the old question_reports table.
   2. Enhance Admin Notifications: I will update src/services/notification_service.py to detect when a new
      feedback item is a question report. It will then format and send the special, detailed notification (with
       question text, options, etc.) to your admin group.
   3. Improve User Notifications: I will also update the notification service to send the more user-friendly
      and contextual DMs to users when the status of their report changes.

  I will begin by reading the necessary files.
