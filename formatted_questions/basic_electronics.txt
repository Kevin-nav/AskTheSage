\textbf{1. The current gain of a transistor is defined as the ratio of the collector current to the}
A. Base current
B. Emitter current
C. Supply current
D. Collector current

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: A.} The common-emitter DC current gain, often called beta ($\beta_{DC}$), is the ratio of the collector current ($I_{C}$) to the base current ($I_{B}$). This is the fundamental definition of current gain in this configuration.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. The graph of current gain versus collector-current indicates that the current gain}
A. Is constant
B. Varies slightly
C. Varies significantly
D. Equals the collector current divided by the base current

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: B.} While often treated as a constant for simple analysis, the current gain ($\beta_{DC}$) of a transistor actually varies slightly with changes in collector current and temperature, as seen on a transistor datasheet.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3. When the collector current increases, what does the current gain do?}
A. Decreases
B. Stays the same
C. Increases
D. Any of the above

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: C.} For a typical BJT, as the collector current ($I_C$) increases from a small value, the current gain ($\beta_{DC}$) also tends to increase until it reaches a peak and then starts to decrease at very high currents. For the purposes of this question, in the general operating range, it increases.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{4. As the temperature increases, the current gain}
A. Decreases
B. Remains the same
C. Increases
D. Can be any of the above

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: C.} The DC current gain of a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) increases with temperature. This is due to the increased thermal energy of the charge carriers, which causes more carriers to be injected from the emitter to the collector.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{5. When the base resistor decreases, the collector voltage will probably}
A. Decrease
B. Stay the same
C. Increase
D. Do all of the above

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: A.} A decrease in the base resistor ($R_B$) will cause the base current ($I_B$) to increase, according to Ohm's law ($I_B = (V_{CC} - V_{BE}) / R_B$). A larger base current leads to a larger collector current ($I_C = \beta I_B$), which in turn causes a greater voltage drop across the collector resistor ($V_R = I_C \times R_C$), leading to a lower collector voltage ($V_C = V_{CC} - V_R$).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{6. If the base resistor is very small, the transistor will operate in the}
A. Cutoff region
B. Active region
C. Saturation region
D. Breakdown region

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: C.} A very small base resistor allows a large base current to flow. This large base current forces the collector current to its maximum possible value, where the transistor can no longer function as an amplifier. This is known as the saturation region, where the collector-emitter voltage ($V_{CE}$) is at its minimum.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{7. Ignoring the bulk resistance of the collector diode, the collector-emitter saturation voltage is}
A. 0
B. A few tenths of a volt
C. 1 V
D. Supply voltage

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: B.} The collector-emitter saturation voltage, $V_{CE(sat)}$, is the voltage drop across the collector and emitter terminals when the transistor is in the saturation region. It is typically a small positive voltage, usually a few tenths of a volt, as a small voltage is still needed to keep the collector-base junction forward-biased.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{8. Three different Q points are shown on a load line. The upper Q point represents the}
A. Minimum current gain
B. Intermediate current gain
C. Maximum current gain
D. Cutoff point

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: C.} The Q point (quiescent point) on a load line moves along the line. An increase in current gain ($\beta$) for a given base current will move the Q point "up" the load line toward the saturation region, which represents a higher collector current and thus a maximum current gain.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{9. If a transistor operates at the middle of the load line, an increase in the base resistance will move the Q point}
A. Down
B. Up
C. Nowhere
D. Off the load line

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: A.} An increase in base resistance ($R_B$) causes a decrease in base current ($I_B$). Since collector current is proportional to base current ($I_C = \beta I_B$), the collector current also decreases. This movement on the load line is represented by the Q point moving "down" toward the cutoff region.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{10. If a transistor operates at the middle of the load line, an increase in the current gain will move the Q point}
A. Down
B. Up
C. Nowhere
D. Off the load line

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: B.} Current gain ($\beta$) directly affects the collector current. An increase in current gain leads to an increase in collector current ($I_C = \beta I_B$). This causes the Q point to move "up" the load line toward the saturation region.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{11. If the base supply voltage increases, the Q point moves}
A. Down
B. Up
C. Nowhere
D. Off the load line

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: B.} Increasing the base supply voltage increases the base current. A larger base current leads to a larger collector current, which shifts the Q point "up" the load line towards saturation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{12. Suppose the base resistor is open. The Q point will be}
A. In the middle of the load line
B. At the upper end of the load line
C. At the lower end of the load line
D. Off the load line

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: C.} If the base resistor is open, there is no path for base current to flow. With zero base current, there is no collector current, and the transistor is in the cutoff region. On the load line, this corresponds to the lowest possible collector current, which is at the lower end of the load line.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{13. If the base supply voltage is disconnected, the collector-emitter voltage will equal}
A. 0 V
B. 6 V
C. 10.5 V
D. Collector supply voltage

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: D.} When the base supply voltage is disconnected, the transistor is in cutoff. In this state, there is no base current and thus no collector current ($I_C = 0$). With no current flowing through the collector resistor, there is no voltage drop across it ($V_R = I_C \times R_C = 0$). Therefore, the voltage at the collector terminal is equal to the collector supply voltage ($V_{CC}$), so $V_{CE} = V_{CC}$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{14. If the base resistor is shorted, the transistor will probably be}
A. Saturated
B. In cutoff
C. Destroyed
D. None of the above

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: C.} A shorted base resistor means a very large, uncontrolled base current will flow. This can exceed the maximum ratings of the transistor, leading to a catastrophic failure and destroying the device.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{15. If the collector resistor decreases to zero in a base-biased circuit, the load line will become}
A. Horizontal
B. Vertical
C. Useless
D. Flat

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: B.} The load line is defined by the equation $V_{CE} = V_{CC} - I_C \times R_C$. If the collector resistor ($R_C$) is zero, the equation becomes $V_{CE} = V_{CC}$. This means that the collector-emitter voltage is fixed at the supply voltage regardless of the collector current, resulting in a vertical load line.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{16. The collector current is $10\ \text{mA}$. If the current gain is 100, the base current is}
A. $1\ \mu\text{A}$
B. $10\ \mu\text{A}$
C. $100\ \mu\text{A}$
D. $1\ \text{mA}$

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: C.} The formula for current gain is $\beta = I_C / I_B$. To find the base current, we rearrange the formula to $I_B = I_C / \beta$.
    $I_B = 10\ \text{mA} / 100 = 0.1\ \text{mA} = 100\ \mu\text{A}$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{17. The base current is $50\ \mu\text{A}$. If the current gain is 125, the collector current is closest in value to}
A. $40\ \mu\text{A}$
B. $500\ \mu\text{A}$
C. $1\ \text{mA}$
D. $6\ \text{mA}$

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: D.} Using the formula $I_C = \beta \times I_B$:
    $I_C = 125 \times 50\ \mu\text{A} = 6250\ \mu\text{A} = 6.25\ \text{mA}$. The closest value is $6\ \text{mA}$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{18. When the Q point moves along the load line, the voltage increases when the collector current}
A. Decreases
B. Stays the same
C. Increases
D. Does none of the above

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: A.} The load line equation is $V_{CE} = V_{CC} - I_C \times R_C$. The relationship is inverse; as collector current ($I_C$) decreases, the voltage drop across the collector resistor ($I_C \times R_C$) decreases, and thus the collector-emitter voltage ($V_{CE}$) increases.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{19. When there is no base current in a transistor switch, the output voltage from the transistor is}
A. Low
B. High
C. Unchanged
D. Unknown

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: B.} No base current means the transistor is in cutoff. In cutoff, no collector current flows, so there is no voltage drop across the collector resistor. The output voltage at the collector is therefore high, equal to the supply voltage ($V_{CC}$).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{20. A circuit with a fixed emitter current is called}
A. Base bias
B. Emitter bias
C. Transistor bias
D. Two-supply bias

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: B.} Emitter bias is a type of biasing circuit that uses a resistor in the emitter leg to provide a negative feedback mechanism. This makes the emitter current highly stable and independent of the transistor's current gain.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{21. The first step in analyzing emitter-based circuits is to find the}
A. Base current
B. Emitter voltage
C. Emitter current
D. Collector current

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: A.} For emitter-based circuits, the analysis typically begins by finding the base current ($I_B$) using the voltage divider rule and the base-emitter voltage drop. This is the first step in finding all other currents and voltages in the circuit.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{22. If the current gain is unknown in an emitter-biased circuit, you cannot calculate the}
A. Emitter voltage
B. Emitter current
C. Collector current
D. Base current

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: D.} Emitter bias circuits are designed to be relatively independent of current gain ($\beta$). You can calculate the emitter voltage and emitter current using the voltage divider rule and Ohm's law, and the collector current will be very close to the emitter current ($I_C \approx I_E$). However, the base current is directly dependent on $\beta$ ($I_B = I_E / (\beta + 1)$), so you cannot find it without knowing the current gain.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{23. If the emitter resistor is open, the collector voltage is}
A. Low
B. High
C. Unchanged
D. Unknown

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: B.} An open emitter resistor breaks the circuit loop for the emitter and collector currents. No current can flow from the emitter to the collector. The transistor is effectively in the cutoff region, meaning there is no voltage drop across the collector resistor, and the collector voltage is high, equal to the supply voltage ($V_{CC}$).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{24. If the collector resistor is open, the collector voltage is}
A. Low
B. High
C. Unchanged
D. Unknown

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: D.} If the collector resistor is open, the collector terminal is no longer connected to the supply voltage through the resistor. The voltage at the collector is undefined or "floating" as it's not referenced to a known potential.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{25. When the current gain increases from 50 to 300 in an emitter-biased circuit, the collector current}
A. Remains almost the same
B. Decreases by a factor of 6
C. Increases by a factor of 6
D. Is zero

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: A.} The key advantage of emitter-biased circuits is their stability. The emitter resistor provides negative feedback that stabilizes the collector current against changes in the current gain ($\beta$) and temperature. While there will be a very slight change, for practical purposes, it remains almost the same.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{26. If the emitter resistance decreases, the collector voltage}
A. Decreases
B. Stays the same
C. Increases
D. Breaks down the transistor

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: A.} A decrease in emitter resistance ($R_E$) will cause the emitter current ($I_E$) to increase. Since the collector current ($I_C$) is approximately equal to the emitter current ($I_C \approx I_E$), the collector current will also increase. This leads to a larger voltage drop across the collector resistor, resulting in a lower collector voltage ($V_C = V_{CC} - I_C \times R_C$).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{27. If the emitter resistance decreases, the}
A. Q point moves up
B. Collector current decreases
C. Q point stays where it is
D. Current gain increases

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Answer: A.} As explained for question 26, a decrease in emitter resistance leads to an increase in collector current. On the load line, an increase in collector current corresponds to the Q point moving "up" the load line towards the saturation region.
\end{itemize}

\question{When operated in cut-off and saturation, the transistor acts like a}
\begin{choices}
    \choice variable resistor
    \choice variable capacitor
    \choice linear amplifier
    \choice switch
\end{choices}
\answer{d}
\explanation{The cut-off state, where no current flows, represents an open switch. The saturation state, where maximum current flows, represents a closed switch. Alternating between these two states allows the transistor to function as an electronic switch.}

\question{A bipolar NPN transistor has a DC current gain value of 180. Calculate the base current required to switch a resistive load of 50 $\Omega$ with collector current given as 4 mA.}
\begin{choices}
    \choice 0.0222 mA
    \choice 0.57143 mA
    \choice 0.53809 mA
    \choice 3.8095 $\mu$A
\end{choices}
\answer{a}
\explanation{The DC current gain ($\beta_{DC}$) is the ratio of collector current ($I_C$) to base current ($I_B$). The formula is $I_B = I_C / \beta_{DC}$. Therefore, $I_B = 4 \text{ mA} / 180 = 0.0222 \text{ mA}$.}

\question{To saturate a BJT,}
\begin{choices}
    \choice $V_{CC}$ must be at least 10 V
    \choice $I_B = I_{C(sat)}$
    \choice the emitter must be grounded
    \choice $I_B \ge I_{C(sat)} / \beta_{DC}$
\end{choices}
\answer{d}
\explanation{To ensure a transistor is in saturation, the base current ($I_B$) must be equal to or greater than the minimum current required for saturation. This minimum current is calculated by dividing the saturation collector current ($I_{C(sat)}$) by the DC current gain ($\beta_{DC}$).}

\question{A FET has three terminals, namely}
\begin{choices}
    \choice emitter, base and collector
    \choice gate, drain and source
    \choice cathode, anode and grid
    \choice none of the above
\end{choices}
\answer{b}
\explanation{A Field-Effect Transistor (FET) is a three-terminal device. These terminals are named the gate, which controls the current flow; the source, where charge carriers enter; and the drain, where they exit.}

\question{Find the DC current gain and the emitter current for a transistor where the base current is 50 mA and the collector current is 3.65 mA.}
\begin{choices}
    \choice 0.073 and 53.65 mA
    \choice 1.073 and 5.65 mA
    \choice 0.77 and 52.65 mA
    \choice 7.073 and 35.65 mA
\end{choices}
\answer{a}
\explanation{The DC current gain ($\beta_{DC}$) is $I_C / I_B$, which is $3.65 \text{ mA} / 50 \text{ mA} = 0.073$. The emitter current ($I_E$) is the sum of the base and collector currents ($I_B + I_C$), which is $50 \text{ mA} + 3.65 \text{ mA} = 53.65 \text{ mA}$.}

\question{A certain transistor has $h_{FE}$ of 200. When the base current is 50 $\mu$A, find $I_C$ and $\alpha_{DC}$.}
\begin{choices}
    \choice 10000 $\mu$A and 0.995
    \choice 1000 $\mu$A and 1
    \choice 100 $\mu$A and 0.95
    \choice 1000 $\mu$A and 0.999
\end{choices}
\answer{a}
\explanation{$h_{FE}$ is the same as $\beta_{DC}$. Collector current $I_C = \beta_{DC} \times I_B = 200 \times 50 \mu\text{A} = 10,000 \mu\text{A}$ (or 10 mA). Emitter current $I_E = I_B + I_C = 0.05 \text{ mA} + 10 \text{ mA} = 10.05 \text{ mA}$. The DC alpha ($\alpha_{DC}$) = $I_C / I_E = 10 \text{ mA} / 10.05 \text{ mA} \approx 0.995$.}

\end{choices}
\answer{a}
\explanation{An open base resistor means there is no path for the base current to flow ($I_B = 0$). Since the collector current depends on the base current ($I_C = \beta_{DC} \times I_B$), the collector current will also be zero (ideally), and the transistor is in cut-off.}

\explanation{When operated in its reverse breakdown region, a Zener diode maintains a nearly constant voltage across its terminals, making it ideal for voltage regulation.}

\question{The capacitance of a varactor diode increases when the reverse voltage across it}
\begin{choices}
    \choice decreases
    \choice increases
    \choice breaks down
    \choice stores charges
\end{choices}
\answer{a}
\explanation{The capacitance of a varactor is inversely proportional to the width of its depletion layer. Decreasing the reverse voltage narrows the depletion layer, which in turn increases the capacitance.}

\question{The device associated with voltage-controlled capacitance is a?}
\begin{choices}
    \choice Light-emitting diode
    \choice Photodiode
    \choice Varactor diode
    \choice Zener diode
\end{choices}
\answer{c}
\explanation{A varactor diode is specifically designed to function as a variable capacitor, where its capacitance is controlled by the amount of reverse-bias voltage applied to it.}

\question{If the depletion layer width decreases, the capacitance}
\begin{choices}
    \choice increases
    \choice decreases
    \choice reverses
    \choice remains constant
\end{choices}
\answer{a}
\explanation{The depletion layer acts as the dielectric of a capacitor. As the distance between the capacitor plates (the width of the depletion layer) decreases, the capacitance increases.}

\question{If the ambient temperature of a high-intensity LED increases, its luminous flux output}
\begin{choices}
    \choice increases
    \choice decreases
    \choice reverses
    \choice remains constant
\end{choices}
